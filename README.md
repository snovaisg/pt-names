# PT-names 
A package to handle portuguese PT names. Can generate random names and classify gender of a name.

Um pacote para processar nomes portugueses (de Portugal). Consegue gerar nomes aleatórios e classificar se um nome é masculino ou feminino.


Based off of https://pypi.org/project/pt-name-gen/ which had a few bugs and couldn't find their github repo to fork.

Don't know where list of names was obtained from.
